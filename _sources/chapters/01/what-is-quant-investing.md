What is Quantitative Investing?
====================

Quantitative investing is about using
large and diverse data
sets through exploration, prediction, and inference together with theory to reach better investment decisions.  Exploration involves
identifying patterns in asset prices.  Prediction involves using information
we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew.  Inference
involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the patterns that we found in our data also appear in new data? How accurate are our predictions? Our primary
tools for exploration are visualizations and descriptive statistics, for
prediction are regression analysis and machine learning, and for inference are
statistical tests and models.

Statistics is a central component of Quantitative investing because statistics
studies how to make robust conclusions based on incomplete information. Computing
is a central component because programming allows us to apply analysis
techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in real-world
applications: not just numbers, but also text, images, and videos.
For this we will mostly focus on numerical data, but the analysis here will extend naturally
to a variety of other inputs.

Quantitative investing is better described as the combination of traditional finance theory with data Science.
