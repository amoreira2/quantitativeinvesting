    "    - What is important is that for each stock in each date you have a value for this characteristic\n",
    "2. On a given date sort stocks by this characterisitc. \n",
    "    - It is key that this characteristic is infact known at sorting date!\n",
    "    - Extremely careful not to introduce \"look-ahead\" bias\n",
    "3. Construct portfolios by dividing stocks in deciles/quinties and form portfolios of stocks that have similar characteristic\n",
    "    - You can either equal weight or value weight within portfolio\n",
    "    - But what is important is that each portfolio will have stocks of have ver different chracteristic values\n",
    "4. Construct the long-short where you go long portfolio 10 and short portfolio 1 (or vice versa) but the point is to take a bet on the characteristic spread    "
